CONSOLIDATION DOCUMENT 2 - ARCHERON1148

>Discuss at least one ‘fail’ and one ‘win’. 

My fail for this module is in writing this document. I had already procrastinated before I realized that I had not yet gotten my feedback for last week, then after that it took me quite a while to organize my thoughts on what I wanted to write about. I had vague ideas but my mind was still cluttered from other things and I was a bit underslept, so I ended up procrastinating a bit more. The issue here was I think not sleeping properly and not organizing my thoughts through writing: generally it helps a lot when I am stuck at a point like that where my thoughts are unorganized to try to get the process started, and normally I think I would have done that if the work was not totally digital - it seems that I sort of forgot about that strategy because I've been writing everything up till now here in github. In future I think I'll try to use paper more to start the iterative writing process.

My win for this module is... also writing this document, because after now struggling with the ideas I had for so long and refining them into a more coherent state feels pretty good. I am quite happy with this consolidation document in the end :).

>What has been most challenging for you so far, and why is that? 

I am still feeling a little bit overwealmed trying to keep up with my six courses, but in order to not simply repeat my document from last module, I will instead discuss two other challenges. The first has to do with one reading in particular: I found the language in the Messy Assembleges article incredibly hard to follow. As interesting as some of the ideas that I did get out of it were, I felt like I missed out on a lot because of the vocabulary. At the risk of being a little bit ignorant, some of the language seemed needlessly confusing: for example, though I understand the authors are trying to illustrate a specific point, I can't help but feel that "The excavator cuts through pre-existing deposits redepositing materials from earlier temporal horizons into subsequent, increasingly messy, assemblages and contexts containing (re)mixed, or reworked, components originating from multiple temporal horizons" is an incredibly convoluted way to talk about "the sinking of a well." Secondly, I have seen the term 'ontologies' used in this and quite a few of the other readings for this course, but while im familiar with ontology in the general philosophical sense, I'm not sure I understand the way it is being used in these articles.

>This module has been about ‘Considering|Critiquing’, where we have tried to both find the patterns in data but also think about the ways we collect that data impact the kinds of patterns we might see. Given what you’ve read and explored in this last module, what are the implications for ‘doing’ digital archaeology… and are they different from what you were thinking at the end of module 1? What are some of the new dilemmas to the work you’ve encountered so far?

I would like to start with a word on data collection: Angela  M.  Labrador writes the following in her article, "Ontologies  of  the  Future  and  Interfaces for All": "the  cataloguing  and  data-entry  process  have  impacts  upon how we see  our  data and  how we predetermine  future  modes of  access  and interpretation." This is as much true for both digital and non-digital data collection. Because all knowledge creation depends on data, the data that we collect today has a grand influence in determining the knowledge that can be created tomorrow. Labrador writes that "Because many archaeological methods are destructive, databases serve as important archives of former states of being," but I would contest that, in a sense, all archaeological methods are destructive, or more precisely, transformative - in that they transform the original arti*fact* into a sort of data fiction which is a step away from the truth. This means we have to absolutely pay attention to the methods for both creation and storage of data. J. Hugget's "The Apparatus of Digital Archaeology" calls for a deeper analysis of the tools used for data collection, showing how many tools can be thought of as performing an external cognitive process which contains knowledge in its own right and in my week five journal, I discussed how when we enter artifacts into a database (for example, when recording the stones in the kobotoolbox form), the database's schema encodes certain assumptions and strips away many nuances automatically. It is important to pay attention to how with each transformation or reuse of data, it becomes increasingly distorted as Ian Dawson and Paul Reilly observe in "Messy Assemblages, Risiduality and Recursion within a Phygital Nexus." These mechanics, I believe, exist in both digital and analogue methods of archaeological data collection and storage, they simply do it differently. Though there are some 'technological fetishists' that would like to think that the digital is more scientific, I don't think either can be described that way. They are simply different methods, digital and analogue methods of observation will therefore highlight different parts of a phenomenon. What I think is most important is to realize (paraphrasing one of our classes annotations on  Morag M. Kersel's chapter, "Response: Living a Semi-digital Kinda Life," in *Mobilizing the Past for a Digital Future*) is that both have their advantages and disadvantages, and we should be aware of whats being missed with either.

Another dimension of digital archaeology that was explored in this module was some of its structural issues. "Why the Whiteness of Archaeology Is a Problem" by William White and Catherine Draycott critisizes archaeology's prevailing white-male-ness: "Unconscious bias means that white leadership, like male-only leadership, too often ends up replicating and reinforcing the status quo, however unintentionally." Kersel's "Response: Living a Semi-digital Kinda Life" suggests that this issue has become even worse with the shift to digital techniques. This is certainly something to be aware of but I don't think its such an easy fix as hiring more POC and women in archaeology; Actions like this may help, but the root of the issue is further down at the level of socio-economic inequality and cultural conditioning. Another structural issue to be aware of has to do with funding: a lack of proper funding, or more likely, a demand from the top-down for a kind of 'speed archaeology' with digital tools (in order to finish a study in as little time - and therefore with as little expense - as possible) should really be subject to critical evaluation. But even where there is proper funding, we ought to be observant of where it comes from and what their goals are: in "What do spatial approaches to the history of archaeology tell us? Insights from post-colonial India" Neha Gupta attempts to expose the 'convenient' political implications of some Indian government funded archaeological studies i.e. how their findings were used in support of the Hindutva movement's goals. I think that its rare that researchers go out into the field intending to make this or that political statement with their work, ideology generally operates on a more subversive level than that, but biases are nonetheless active and we must consider them and the political implications of archaeological studies.

I would finally like to talk about the artistic side of digital archaeology. The reason I was able to connect so easily with this is I think a result of my interest in historical video games. I am a computer science student in the game development stream, and I think that video games have the potential to be a great way to teach history and my own personal experience proves it definitly can be a great way to at least get people interested in history (I first developed my fond interest in history through Civilization V). Colleen Morgan describes one more artistic approach to archaeology in her "Avatars, Monsters, and Machines: A Cyborg Archaeology": "A cyborg archaeology is a practice in worlding, in Heidegger's (2010) sense of being-in-the-world, but also as world-building in science fiction and video game creation. From this stance, creating archaeological interpretations is endlessly immersive, a process that I have compared to telepresence, ‘where you are when you are talking on the phone’ (Rucker et al., 1992)." Here, it seems there is a shift of focus from a purely scientific approach to understanding the past to an artistic approach to understanding people: by putting oneself in another's virtual shoes, you can gain a better understanding of the way they see their world and why they do the things they do. My understanding of cyborg archaeology here is that it is essentially the application of a method also found in Chinua Achebe's *Things Fall Apart*. Models are another artistic tool that can be used to understand the past, and I think that they can be very effectively combined with cyborg archaeology and then gamified to produce pretty useful educational tools: an example of this to me is the game Crusader Kings III, where the player is placed in the role of a medieval lord in what is essentially a massive simulatory model of the medieval world. The player can develop a virtual first hand understanding of feudal era politics through having to deal with troublesome vassals, succession law, peasant uprisings, and the Pope. But it should not go unnoticed that this artistic approach to archaeology deserves its own attention to the ethical dimension. One quick issue has to do with very clearly identifying what the scope of a model's accuracy is: for example, in Crusader Kings III the mechanics are modeled to most accurately portray the politics of the medieval european and islamic worlds, but the game world itself spans all the way from West Africa to Tibet. Currently, the game mechanics in those areas outside those core regions are not as detailed or specified to the historical realities of those areas so that if you are playing as a Raja in India it is a very similar experience to playing as a European Duke. To someone without prior knowledge this may lead to the idea that the social formation of India was identical to that of Europe at the time. Also, we ought to be considerate when we are thinking about using the histories of foreign nations to enrichen our own cultural experience in the first world: I don't think this is nessesarily a bad thing in and of itself, but situations like the 3D printed Palmyra arch remind us that we must have a certain level of awareness and responsibilty when 'borrowing'.
