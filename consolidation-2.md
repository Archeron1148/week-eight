CONSOLIDATION DOCUMENT 2 - ARCHERON1148

>Discuss at least one ‘fail’ and one ‘win’. 

fail --> getting stuck

win --> 

>What has been most challenging for you so far, and why is that? 

keeping up still lol

assemblages language

an archaeology which presents itself as non-ideological, but remains ideological

>This module has been about ‘Considering|Critiquing’, where we have tried to both find the patterns in data but also think about the ways we collect that data impact the kinds of patterns we might see. Given what you’ve read and explored in this last module, what are the implications for ‘doing’ digital archaeology… and are they different from what you were thinking at the end of module 1? What are some of the new dilemmas to the work you’ve encountered so far?

Angela  M.  Labrador writes the following in her article, *Ontologies  of  the  Future  and  Interfaces for  All*: "the  cataloguing  and  data-entry  process  have  impacts  upon how we see  our  data and  how we predetermine  future  modes of  access  and interpretation."
artifact to data conversion --> "Because many archaeological methods are destructive, databases serve as important archives of former states of being." -Ontologies of the Future
each transformation of data brings it further from the original fact
The Apparatus of Digital Archaeology -> we have to pay attention to the tools themselves and what kind of knowledge they imbed

funding, profit motive, speed archaeology

science? politics?
"Bias extends straight to the core of general disciplinary theory,   where   the   so-called   ‘grand   challenges’   of archaeology   today   (Kintigh et  al.,   2014)   appear   to betray both a pervasive focus on archaeology as science (where our practice could be read as primarily a natural science:  materialist,  positivist  and  objective),  and  an absence  of  concern  for  archaeology  as  politics  (as  per critique by Cobb, 2014)." -Theorising the Digital, Perry, Taylor
"the   nationally   oriented   framework   takes   a   caste-based  view  of  prehistory.  In  this  historical  framework,  Indian  archaeology  assumes  cultural  continuity  between  contemporary  and  prehistoric  societies." -What do spatial approaches to the history of archaeology tell us? Insights from post-colonial India, Gupta

funding is certainly a structural issue, but another class of structural issues is:
Why the Whiteness of Archaeology Is a Problem, white, draycott -> "Unconscious bias means that white leadership, like male-only leadership, too often ends up replicating and reinforcing the status quo, however unintentionally."
What Gets Counted Counts, D'Ignazio, Klein

cyborg archaeology --> art, assemblages
 I like that you connect with the ‘artistic’ side of digital archaeology. Do you see any ways in which ‘tuning’ an ABM or gpt-2 might fall under that rubric? When we build simulations of the past, we have to record in our notes what we expect to find (based on our experience, our understanding of the phenomena) before running the simulation, to compare with what emerges from the simulation; this guards against making just-so stories to justify what emerges after the fact - we use simulations to explore the space between our expectations and the emergent outcomes.
"A cyborg archaeology is a practice in worlding, in Heidegger's (2010) sense of being-in-the-world, but also as world-building in science fiction and video game creation. From this stance, creating archaeological interpretations is endlessly immersive, a process that I have compared to telepresence, ‘where you are when you are talking on the phone’ (Rucker et al., 1992)." - Avatars, Monsters, and Machines: A Cyborg Archaeology, Colleen Morgan
what is the value of a model?
"I am always amused when these same people challenge me with the question, “Can you validate your model?” The appropriate retort, of course, is, “Can you validate yours?” At least I can write mine down so that it can, in principle, be calibrated to data, if that is what you mean by “validate,” a term I assiduously avoid (good Popperian that I am). The choice, then, is not whether to build models; it’s whether to build explicit ones." - ODATE 4.4, Graham et al.
